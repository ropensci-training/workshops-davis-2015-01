## Collect common names from taxonomic names

You may want to collect taxonomic names for some reason in your research. taxize has a number of ways to do this. One is using `sci2comm` function

```{r commonnames, eval=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
splist <- c("Helianthus annuus","Pinus contorta","Collomia grandiflora","Abies magnifica","Rosa californica","Datura wrightii","Mimulus bicolor","Nicotiana glauca","Madia sativa","Bartlettia scaposa")

comnames <- sci2comm(splist, db="itis", simplify=TRUE)

# Unfortunately, common names are not standardized like species names, so there are multiple common names for each taxon
sapply(comnames, nrow)

# So let's just take the first common name for each species
comnames_vec <- sapply(comnames, function(x) as.character(x$comname[[1]]), USE.NAMES=FALSE)

# And we can make a data.frame of our scientific and common names
(allnames <- data.frame(spname = splist, comname = comnames_vec))
```
