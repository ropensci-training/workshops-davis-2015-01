## Reproduce this talk

My repo of talk is pretty big, sorry about that. Working on reducing size by reducing duplicated dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/workshops-montreal-2013-12
open workshops-montreal-2013-12/00-introduction/intro_slides/index.html
```

To use grunt/npm (you have to have npm installed of course)

```
git clone https://github.com/workshops-montreal-2013-12
cd workshops-montreal-2013-12/00-introduction/intro_slides
npm install
grunt serve
```

Then go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view your presentation
